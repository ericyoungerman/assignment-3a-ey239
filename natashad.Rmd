## About me

- I am broadly interested in ecology and plant diversity, and how they can be applied to make organic and conventional agriculture more sustainable and resource efficient.

- I have experience examining the influence of on-farm biodiversity in diversified vegetable and dairy farms through beetle banks and native meadows.

-  I am currently leading a multi-institutional project investigating how to improve the yield and weed suppression of perennial grain cropping systems.
